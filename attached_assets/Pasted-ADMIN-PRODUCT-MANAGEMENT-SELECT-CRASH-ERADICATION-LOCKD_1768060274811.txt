ADMIN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT — SELECT CRASH ERADICATION (LOCKDOWN)

CONTEXT
Vendor product forms are now stable.
Admin product management is still crashing due to Radix Select receiving empty string values.

This task is ADMIN-ONLY.
Do NOT touch vendor product forms unless explicitly required to remove shared crashes.

--------------------------------------------------
ABSOLUTE RULES
- Do NOT refactor vendor forms
- Do NOT add features
- Do NOT change database schema
- Do NOT re-architect product forms again
- Do NOT declare success until Admin pages no longer crash

--------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE
Eliminate ALL empty-string Select values from the ADMIN surface.

After this task:
- Admin product management must NEVER crash
- No <Select.Item value=""> may exist
- No Select value may resolve to ""

--------------------------------------------------
MANDATORY AUDIT (DO ALL)

Search the ENTIRE codebase for:

1) <Select.Item value="">
2) value=""
3) defaultValue=""
4) placeholder Select options mapped as ""

This includes:
- Admin product edit pages
- Admin product tables
- Admin filters
- Admin bulk actions
- Any shared Select component used by Admin

--------------------------------------------------
PART A — ADMIN PRODUCT EDIT FORM

If Admin uses:
- A separate form from vendor → fix it
- A shared form → confirm sentinel logic is respected

MANDATORY RULES:
- All Select components must use "__unset__" sentinel
- defaultValue MUST be "__unset__" (never "")
- When hydrating existing product data:
  - Normalize "" → "__unset__"
  - Normalize null → "__unset__"

--------------------------------------------------
PART B — ADMIN PRODUCT LIST / FILTERS (MOST LIKELY CAUSE)

Admin tables often use Select filters.

MANDATORY FIX:
- Any filter dropdown MUST:
  - Use "__all__" or "__unset__"
  - NEVER use empty string as option value
- Placeholder options must NOT have a value prop at all

--------------------------------------------------
PART C — HARD GUARD (REQUIRED)

Add a defensive assertion in Admin-only Select wrappers:

If a Select value resolves to "":
→ throw a controlled error in development
→ normalize to "__unset__" in production

This prevents future regressions.

--------------------------------------------------
VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)

Login as Admin:
Email: the3rdukem@gmail.com
Password: 123asdqweX$

MANUALLY CONFIRM:

1) Open Admin → Products
2) Open Product Edit
3) Change category / condition / any Select
4) Use filters and dropdowns
5) Refresh page
6) Navigate away and back

RESULTS REQUIRED:
- NO console errors
- NO Radix Select crashes
- NO empty string Select values anywhere

--------------------------------------------------
SUCCESS CRITERIA (STRICT)

You may ONLY report success if:
- Admin product pages load consistently
- No Radix Select empty string errors appear
- Vendor product forms remain untouched
- You explicitly list every file where empty string Selects were removed

Do NOT declare success early.
Fix until Admin is fully stable.
