You are performing a REGRESSION REPAIR on the KIOSK marketplace.

DO NOT add new features.
DO NOT refactor unrelated code.
DO NOT “improve” anything.

Your task is to:
1) Identify what the Reviews implementation broke
2) Restore Products, Counts, and Visibility
3) Fix ONLY the missing Review requirements

========================================
PHASE 1 — READ-ONLY AUDIT (MANDATORY)
========================================

Before changing ANY code:

- Identify ALL files modified during the reviews implementation
- List:
  - product queries touched
  - joins added
  - filters modified
  - Zustand stores affected
  - API routes changed

Specifically inspect:
- product list queries (admin, vendor, homepage)
- product status filters
- joins between products ↔ reviews
- any INNER JOIN usage
- any WHERE clauses referencing reviews

DO NOT CHANGE CODE in this phase.

========================================
PHASE 2 — PRODUCT VISIBILITY RESTORATION
========================================

Restore product visibility so that:

- Admin product list shows ALL products immediately
- Vendor product list shows ALL vendor products immediately
- Homepage product grid loads correctly without delay
- Counts match visible products

Rules:
- Product queries must NOT depend on reviews
- Reviews must NEVER filter products
- Use LEFT JOIN only if absolutely required
- Default product listing must ignore reviews entirely

Validate by:
✔ Creating a product
✔ Seeing it immediately in admin, vendor, and homepage
✔ Refreshing browser

========================================
PHASE 3 — FIX REVIEWS WITHOUT TOUCHING PRODUCTS
========================================

Fix ONLY these review issues:

1) Photo uploads:
   - Implement actual upload UI
   - Persist media
   - Display images on product page

2) Vendor visibility:
   - Vendors must see reviews for their products
   - Query must resolve via product_id → vendor_id

Rules:
- Do NOT modify product queries
- Do NOT modify product schemas
- Do NOT modify counts logic

========================================
PHASE 4 — VERIFICATION
========================================

Manually verify:

✔ Products visible everywhere
✔ Product counts correct
✔ Reviews show in admin
✔ Reviews show in vendor dashboard
✔ Review photos upload and persist
✔ No console errors

If ANY product disappears:
STOP and FIX before reporting success.

========================================
FINAL RULE
========================================

DO NOT report success unless:
- Products behave EXACTLY as before reviews
- Reviews work independently
