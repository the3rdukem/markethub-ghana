You are fixing PRODUCT GOVERNANCE & VISIBILITY in the KIOSK marketplace.

AUTH, DATABASE, DRAFT LOGIC, AND VENDOR FLOWS ARE STABLE.
DO NOT modify authentication, database schemas, or external APIs.

This task focuses on:
- Admin product controls
- Duplicate product navigation
- Product count clarity

========================================
SECTION 1 — ADMIN PRODUCT MANAGEMENT (CRITICAL)
========================================

Admin MUST be able to manage ANY product.

Fix Admin → Products so that admin can:
- Edit product
- Suspend / unsuspend product
- Feature / unfeature product
- Change product status (draft / published)

Rules:
- Admin actions must persist immediately
- Admin does NOT require vendor ownership
- UI controls must be visible and functional
- Actions must update counts and tables in real-time

========================================
SECTION 2 — DUPLICATE PRODUCT NAVIGATION
========================================

Fix vendor "Duplicate Product" flow.

Rules:
- Server must return the NEW product ID
- Client MUST navigate to:
  /vendor/products/edit/{newProductId}

No redirects to missing IDs.
No "Product not found" after duplication.

========================================
SECTION 3 — PRODUCT COUNT CLARITY (ADMIN)
========================================

Fix admin product counts to reduce ambiguity.

Rules:
- Dashboard tiles may show TOTAL products
- Product tabs must show clear labels:
  - Published (X)
  - Drafts (Y)
  - Suspended (Z)
- Do NOT repurpose counts for unrelated metrics
- Users tab must follow same consistency rules

========================================
SECTION 4 — REAL-TIME UI CONSISTENCY
========================================

Ensure:
- Product tables update immediately after admin actions
- No logout/login required to see updates
- Counts and tables always agree

========================================
FINAL VALIDATION CHECKLIST (MANDATORY)
========================================

This task is complete ONLY IF:

- Admin can edit, feature, suspend products
- Duplicate product redirects to correct edit page
- Product counts are accurate and clearly labeled
- No stale or misleading counters remain
- No auth or DB logic was changed
