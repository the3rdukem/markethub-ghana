You are completing the Reviews system for the KIOSK marketplace.

DO NOT modify:
- Product queries
- Product visibility logic
- Marketplace search
- Rating filters
- Any unrelated features

This task is ONLY about:
1) Buyer review ownership controls
2) Vendor review visibility

========================================
SECTION 1 — BUYER REVIEW OWNERSHIP (CRITICAL)
========================================

Buyers MUST be able to:

- Edit their own review
- Delete their own review

Rules:
- A buyer can ONLY edit or delete reviews they created
- Editing must update text, rating, and photos
- Deleting must soft-delete (retain for audit)
- UI must reflect changes immediately

Required:
- PATCH /api/reviews/:id
- DELETE /api/reviews/:id
- Server-side ownership validation (user_id check)
- Clear error messages if unauthorized

========================================
SECTION 2 — VENDOR REVIEW VISIBILITY (CRITICAL)
========================================

Vendors MUST be able to:

- View ALL reviews for products they own
- See review text, rating, photos, and buyer name
- See review status (visible / hidden)

Rules:
- Reviews must be resolved via:
  product_id → vendor.user_id
- Do NOT query by vendor entity ID
- Do NOT filter reviews incorrectly by status unless intentional

Fix:
- Vendor Reviews page must show the same reviews visible on product pages

========================================
SECTION 3 — DATA & ACCESS RULES
========================================

Enforce:
- Buyer: CRUD only on own reviews
- Vendor: Read-only access to reviews on own products
- Admin: Full moderation powers

All access control MUST be server-side.

========================================
SECTION 4 — VERIFICATION (MANDATORY)
========================================

Manually verify:

✔ Buyer can edit a review
✔ Buyer can delete a review
✔ Vendor sees reviews immediately
✔ Admin visibility remains unchanged
✔ No impact to products or counts

DO NOT report success unless ALL checks pass.
