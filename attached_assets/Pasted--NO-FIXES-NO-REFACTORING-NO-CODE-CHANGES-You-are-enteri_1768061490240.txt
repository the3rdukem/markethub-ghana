You are entering INVESTIGATION MODE ONLY.

🚫 DO NOT
	•	Fix anything

	•	Silence the error

If you make any code change, the task is considered FAILED.

🧨 PROBLEM TO INVESTIGATE

The application crashes in Admin → Products Management with the following global error:

A <Select.Item /> must have a value prop that is not an empty string.

Stack trace:

ClientProvider → RootLayout → ErrorBoundary

This confirms the bug is NOT localized to the product form and is coming from a globally rendered Radix Select.

⸻

🎯 INVESTIGATION OBJECTIVE

Identify EVERY location in the codebase where:
	•	<Select.Item value=""> is used
	•	OR a Select receives an empty string ("") as value or defaultValue
	•	OR backend data with "" is passed into a Select
	•	OR “All / None / Unset” options are implemented incorrectly

You must prove which one(s) are responsible for the crash.

⸻

🔬 REQUIRED INVESTIGATION STEPS (ALL MANDATORY)

STEP 1 — GLOBAL SEARCH (NO EXCEPTIONS)

Search the entire repo for:

value=""
defaultValue=""
<Select.Item value=""

Include:
	•	/components
	•	/app
	•	/admin
	•	/providers
	•	/layout
	•	/ui

📌 OUTPUT REQUIRED:
A list of file paths + line numbers for every match.
If there are none, explicitly state “No empty string Select values found”.

⸻

STEP 2 — GLOBAL SELECT INVENTORY

Create a list of every Radix Select component that renders outside product forms, including:
	•	Header dropdowns
	•	User menus
	•	Admin filters
	•	Category selectors
	•	Status selectors
	•	Vendor selectors
	•	Search filters
	•	Any Select rendered inside:
	•	ClientProvider
	•	RootLayout
	•	Layout components
	•	Shared UI components

📌 OUTPUT REQUIRED:
A table with:

File	Component	Purpose	Value Source



⸻

STEP 3 — DATA FLOW TRACE (CRITICAL)

For each Select identified above:
	•	Where does its value come from?
	•	Local state?
	•	Zustand?
	•	API response?
	•	URL params?
	•	Database fields?

Specifically check for:
	•	Empty strings ("")
	•	Nullable fields not normalized
	•	Legacy data (old products, old categories)

📌 OUTPUT REQUIRED:
Explicit YES / NO for:
	•	Can this Select receive an empty string at runtime?

⸻

STEP 4 — ADMIN PRODUCTS PAGE ENTRY TRACE

Without changing code:
	1.	Identify what components mount when navigating to:

/admin/products


	2.	Identify which Selects render immediately (before user interaction)

📌 OUTPUT REQUIRED:
List of components rendered on page entry.

⸻

STEP 5 — CRASH CONFIRMATION MATRIX

For every suspected Select, answer:

Component	Can value=”” occur?	Rendered on admin/products?	Crash plausible?


You must justify each answer.

⸻

📤 FINAL REPORT FORMAT (STRICT)

You MUST return:

1️⃣ Root Cause Candidates

(Numbered, ordered by likelihood)

2️⃣ Primary Offender (if identifiable)

Include:
	•	File path
	•	Component name
	•	How empty string enters the Select

3️⃣ Secondary Risks

Other places that could cause the same crash later

4️⃣ Confirmation Level

One of:
	•	✅ Root cause confirmed
	•	⚠️ Multiple candidates, needs runtime trace
	•	❌ Cause not yet isolated (explain why)

⸻

🛑 FINAL RULES
	•	Do NOT fix the issue
	•	Do NOT add sentinel values
	•	Do NOT change Selects
	•	Do NOT rewrite forms

This is a pure diagnostic exercise.
