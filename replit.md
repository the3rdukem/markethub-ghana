# Sabi Market V3

## Overview
MarketHub is a secure marketplace platform for Ghana, designed to connect buyers with verified vendors. It features Mobile Money payments, robust buyer protection, and a comprehensive admin verification system. The platform aims to provide a reliable and safe e-commerce experience, leveraging modern web technologies for scalability and performance.

I prefer clear and concise communication.

## System Architecture
The platform is built with Next.js 15, Tailwind CSS for styling, and `shadcn/ui` for UI components, ensuring a modern and responsive user experience. PostgreSQL is used as the primary database, managed by Replit, with a focus on connection pooling and async data access.

**Key Technical Implementations:**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with a dedicated Data Access Layer (DAL) using `pg` for connection pooling and async operations. Schema includes proper constraints (UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK, FOREIGN KEY).
- **Authentication**: Server-authoritative session management via a single `session_token` httpOnly cookie. Strong password validation (8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 lowercase, 1 number). Email uniqueness allows same email for buyer+vendor accounts, but admin emails are globally unique. Login provides differentiated error codes for debugging while maintaining secure user-facing messages.
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive server-side validation across all API endpoints with structured error responses including code, message, details, field, and validationErrors array. Client-side password strength indicator on registration form provides real-time feedback. Phase 1.1B added: email garbage detection, name/address content safety filtering, Ghana phone format + global uniqueness check, field-specific error attribution, and single error presentation (inline errors only, no duplicate toasts). Phase 1.1C added: full product form validation parity (name, description, color, brand, tags with profanity/garbage detection), field-specific errors with auto-scroll/focus on failing fields. Phase 1.1D added: form field registration parity (id/name/data-field on all inputs including category Select), complete fieldMap coverage (name, description, category, price, comparePrice, quantity, sku, barcode, color, brand, tags), server-side numeric normalization (quantity→0, comparePrice→null when empty), API response normalization (null quantity/price→0), Radix Select safety (value||"" pattern), and database repair script (fixes NULL quantities on init). **Phase 1.2 (Product Form Architecture Lockdown) - COMPLETE**: Unified React Hook Form controller with Zod schema validation. Key files: `src/lib/forms/product.ts` (schema + transform utilities), `src/lib/forms/useProductForm.ts` (hook wrapping RHF). Sentinel pattern: `UNSET_VALUE = "__unset__"` for Select field defaults to prevent Radix crashes. Server rejects sentinel values ONLY when publishing (status='active'), allowing drafts to save with minimal validation. Condition is a dedicated top-level required field (not in dynamic categoryAttributes). transformFormToApiPayload filters __unset__ values from optional categoryAttributes before submission. transformApiToFormValues handles legacy condition data from categoryAttributes. Required fields: name (always), category/condition/price>0/quantity>=0 (when publishing). Validation split: Draft = name only, Publish = full Zod schema validation. Error UX: inline red borders + auto-scroll/focus on first error field. **Phase 1.2 Recovery (Jan 2026)**: Dynamic category attribute architecture fully implemented across vendor create/edit and admin edit forms. Per-field Controller registration using `name={fieldPath as any}` for dynamic nested paths. Reconciliation effect: triggers on category OR schema change, gated on categoriesLoading, preserves existing values while removing stale keys and seeding defaults for new keys. DynamicAttributeField component renders all field types with proper data-field attributes for scroll-to-error. scrollToFirstError flattens nested categoryAttributes errors. Categories fetched dynamically from /api/categories with memoized currentCategoryFields.
- **Governance System**: Comprehensive system for vendor and product management, including vendor verification, product gating, category management with dynamic form schema, and detailed audit logging for critical administrative actions.
- **Cart System**: Secure cart ownership model with guest and user carts, including guest-to-user cart merging on authentication and persistence for user carts.
- **Reviews System**: Full-fledged database-backed review system allowing buyers to rate products, vendors to reply, and administrators to moderate content.
- **Promotions System**: Database-backed coupons and sales management. Vendors create/manage their own promotions via `/vendor/promotions`. Admins view all promotions read-only at `/admin/promotions`. Coupons are validated at checkout with vendor scoping enforcement (coupons only apply to vendor's products in cart using `eligibleSubtotal`). Sales support multiple products via `sale_products` join table with discount type (percentage/fixed) and date ranges. Active sales are displayed across all product views (homepage, search, product detail) with animated discount badges and struck-through original prices. Products API returns `effectivePrice` computed from active sales and `activeSale` metadata. Cart uses effective prices when adding products with active sales.
- **API-First Approach**: All major data interactions, including product listings, search, vendor analytics, and administrative functions, are handled via dedicated API endpoints, moving away from client-side state management for data consistency.
- **UI/UX**: Utilizes `shadcn/ui` for consistent and accessible components. The platform is designed to be intuitive for buyers, vendors, and administrators, with distinct dashboards for each user type.
